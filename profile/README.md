Independent Society of Knowledge is a decentralized institute for research and education of science, engineering and philosophy. It is based on three core values, Decentralization, Open-Access, and Collaboration. The target audience of our products are people who respect these core values. We strive to build frameworks, platforms, and engagements that promotes our ideas in academia, facilitating knowledge sharing, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration, and bridging the gap between academia and industry.

## Decentralization
Every institute around the globe is being held under an authority, governments and big funders, although this had led academia to grow, in our opinion there’s a need for an alternative route for academic journeys. For ISK to be decentralized means to give researches platforms and values that would let them research in the route they deem necessary. In our opinion ISK can benefit science beside the traditional academia.

## Collaboration
Through the age of computers, there are many open-source projects. For ISK collaboration describes the same attitude. We believe that by providing platforms and frameworks necessary we can bring science and engineering community closer. By let them collaborating on the same projects we can all benefit from such projects more.

## Open-Access
ISK aims to provide people the knowledge at ease. We believe by letting people having a collaboration on science, and by letting that collaboration open and easy to access, we can help researches in a better way. We do not seek to provide access to ones who do not appreciate open-access for all.

## Vision
Our vision is to create an institute that grants humanity a step forward in solving academia challenges and helps science, engineering and philosophy grow more freely. We aim to revolutionize the way knowledge is created, disseminated, and utilized, leading to breakthrough discoveries, innovative solutions, and sustainable progress for future generations. We seek to establish a global network of collaborators, develop cutting-edge tools and resources, and catalyze meaningful change at the intersection of academia, industry, and society.

## Join Our Community
We invite passionate individuals, organizations, and institutions to join our growing community. Together, we can forge new paths, challenge conventional thinking, and shape a future where knowledge knows no boundaries.
