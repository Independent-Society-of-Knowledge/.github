# Welcome to the Independent Society of Knowledge (ISK)

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the **Independent Society of Knowledge (ISK)**—an organization committed to reimagining academia through decentralized, collaborative, and open-access initiatives. We believe in breaking free from the traditional constraints of academic institutions and forging a new path where knowledge is truly accessible, collaborative, and driven by the collective efforts of a global community.
